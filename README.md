Rationale for Task 1 Preserving Categorical Information: In a categorical column, the mode indicates the category that appears most frequently. We guarantee that the imputed values are compatible with the available data and maintain the column's categorical information by imputing missing values using the mode. Reducing Data Loss: Removing rows that have missing category values might result in a considerable loss of data, particularly if there aren't many missing values. We can keep those rows in your dataset by imputation using the method, ensuring that we utilize all of the data that is accessible. Preserving Data Integrity: Imputing data using the mode is an easy-to-use technique that avoids adding bias to the dataset. It has no effect on how the categorical data are distributed generally.
